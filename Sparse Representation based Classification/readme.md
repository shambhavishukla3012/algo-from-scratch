# Sparse Representation based Classification  
  
A classification  approach  is  presented  and  shown  to  be  effective  in many face recognition applications. 
Wright et al.  proposed this method in 2009 and called it Sparse Representation-based Classification(SRC) and reportedinteresting results 
in automatic face recognition application. As name suggests sparse matrices are used for the purpose.  

## The main idea  
SRC(Sparse Representation based Classification) is derived from the linear algebra  'subspaces and basis vectors'. Vector in a subspace can be represented as a linear combination of basis vector of the same subspace. Similarly, in SRC classes are assumed to be divided into different subspaces and a particular sample from a specific class can be represented as a linear combination of the other samples from the same class.
