# Linear_Regression using Gradient Descent  
### Main goal:-   
Perform Linear Regression on the given dataset. Also perform K-Fold cross-validation.  
Choose an appropriate value of K and justify it.  
Include plots between Cost function v/s Iteration-Gradient Descent,  
	and for K fold- Training loss v/s iterations and validation loss v/s iterations.
